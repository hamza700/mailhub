A side project started during covid to help travel companies upsale to their client autonomously. 
With just a flight itinery the system would then send trip ideas to client to purchase hotels and tours in their respective destinations.

For this project i tried to combine the AWS technologies that i learned during my AWS developer certification.
As this was straight after AWS developer certified. The technolgies i used were:
-Serverless
-Lambda
-API Gateway
-DynamoDB
-IAM roles
-S3
-SES
